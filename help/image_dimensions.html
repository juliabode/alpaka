 Image Dimensions
WordPress will generate three versions of the image you upload, all sized to the correct dimensions for the different parts of the site that it may show up on

Shaken Tumble supports the post-thumbnail/featured image feature built into WordPress. By using this method, it will generate three versions of the image you upload, all sized to the correct dimensions for the different parts of the site that it may show up on.

Default Featured Image Size:
Width = 600px
Height = Maximum of 800px

Sidebar Thumbnail:
Width = 75px
Height = 75px

Gallery Images (used in the slideshow of Gallery posts):
Width = 600px
Height = 400px

If, for some reason, you would like to alter these dimensions, you will need to edit the functions.php file and edit the code below the “Set featured image sizes” PHP comment (inside of the shaken_setup() function).
