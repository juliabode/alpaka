Setting Featured Images
Adding featured images to your posts is extremely easy. Simply follow the steps below:

On the Write -> Post page, find the “Featured Image” box (usually on the right sidebar) and click the Set featured image link.
Upload your featured image and then click Use as featured image. WordPress will then automatically create images with the correct dimensions.
